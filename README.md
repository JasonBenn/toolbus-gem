## TOOLBUS-GEM (WIP)

Measure what you know, master what you don’t.

This gem parses your code into syntax trees, compares them to a database of language-specific “missions”, and uploads your completion data to a website where you'll be able to view the most popular missions you haven't yet completed.

This quantifies your knowledge of a programming tool and enables efficient, self-guided, project-based learning.
